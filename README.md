# MedicPal_1.0.0-alpha

MedicPal is a streamlined, user-friendly application designed to assist paramedics and medical professionals during high-stress, task-saturated situations. Engineered with simplicity in mind, it ensures ease of use even under the most intense circumstances, offering a vital reference tool and event tracker for better decision-making and accurate documentation.

We’ve all faced those moments: the 3 AM call after a 24-hour shift with minimal sleep, when task saturation becomes overwhelming. MedicPal is built to reduce the risk of errors and lost time, providing you with a quick and reliable reference to keep you on track.

In the current Alpha version, we are testing the cardiac arrest logger and the RSI (Rapid Sequence Intubation) checklist. The app is designed to be intuitive enough that it can be handed off to a firefighter or police officer on scene, enabling them to assist with reading the checklist, logging treatments, or administration of medications, even with little or no medical training.

Future Updates: The next phases will introduce additional references and tracking tools for critical care scenarios, including:

Trauma Management

Stroke Protocols

STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) Tracking

DIB (Dyspnea and Respiratory Distress) Management

Ventilator Setup and Management

These updates will further enhance the app’s capabilities, providing paramedics with comprehensive tools to support better patient outcomes, improve clinical efficiency, and minimize risks during high-pressure emergencies.

Disclaimer:

MedicPal is intended solely as a reference tool and is not a substitute for professional medical judgment or training. Users are responsible for ensuring that all actions taken during patient care are in accordance with their local protocols, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and medical guidelines. The app is designed to support decision-making, but the final responsibility for treatment and medication administration rests with the healthcare provider. Always verify information and consult appropriate medical resources when needed.
