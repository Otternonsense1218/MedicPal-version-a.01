# MedicPal-version-a.02
A simple event logging application for paramedics and medial professionals.

This is my first application. But I have created a simple event logger.
This application is very early in it's development with some messy code that is not quite streamlined. But I am using it as a proof of concept to myself.
I plan on adding much more to the application and hope to get it to a point where it can be pushed out to mobile devices for tracking in the field.
